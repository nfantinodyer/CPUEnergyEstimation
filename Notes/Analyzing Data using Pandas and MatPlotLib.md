Normalizing DateTime and shifting values so they are lined up, but that was for the Proc Energy graph comparison between the OS's. Now I select columns of interest to view the effects of different CPU events on the power. Here is chatGPT analysis of this matrix:

### 1. **Key Variables**

- **Proc Energy (Joules)**: Represents the processor's energy consumption. Correlations with other metrics highlight factors that contribute to higher/lower energy use.
- **L3MISS/L2MISS (Cache Misses)**: Cache misses often indicate inefficiencies since the CPU needs to fetch data from slower memory, which could increase energy usage.
- **L3HIT/L2HIT (Cache Hits)**: Cache hits imply efficient memory access, potentially reducing energy consumption.
- **EXEC**: Represents execution cycles or the time spent executing instructions.
- **IPC (Instructions Per Cycle)**: A higher IPC means more efficient execution of instructions per CPU cycle, which could correlate inversely with energy usage.
- **FREQ, AFREQ, CFREQ**: Represent CPU frequencies (possibly current, average, and another variation). Higher frequencies typically increase energy consumption.

### 2. **Linux Correlation Matrix Analysis**

#### **Proc Energy (Joules):**

- **Strong Positive Correlation with CFREQ and FREQ**:
    - Energy usage increases with higher CPU frequencies.
    - The correlation is strong (dark red), indicating a direct relationship.
- **Weak Correlation with L3MISS and L2MISS**:
    - Cache misses seem to have a limited impact on energy consumption under Linux.
- **Negative Correlation with IPC**:
    - As IPC increases (indicating more efficient instruction execution), energy consumption decreases (blue color). This shows Linux handles efficiency better as IPC improves.

#### **L3MISS and L2MISS**:

- **Positive Correlation with EXEC**:
    - Cache misses lead to longer execution times, as the CPU needs to spend more time fetching data.
- **Weak or Neutral Correlation with Energy**:
    - Linux appears to mitigate the energy impact of cache misses more effectively.

#### **Frequency Metrics (FREQ, AFREQ, CFREQ)**:

- **Strong Correlation with Each Other**:
    - Predictably, frequency metrics are tightly linked.
- **Strong Positive Correlation with Energy**:
    - Higher CPU frequencies are directly tied to higher energy consumption.

#### **Overall Findings**

The correlation matrices for Linux and Windows reveal key differences in how system parameters like energy consumption, cache performance, and frequency metrics are interrelated. These insights point to potential areas of optimization for each operating system.

#### **Key Differences Between Linux and Windows**

1. **Energy Consumption**:
    
    - In Linux, energy consumption (`Proc Energy`) is strongly correlated with CPU frequency metrics (`FREQ`, `AFREQ`, `CFREQ`), suggesting that dynamic frequency scaling plays a significant role in energy efficiency. Cache misses (`L3MISS`, `L2MISS`) have a weaker impact on energy, showing that Linux mitigates memory inefficiencies better.
    - In Windows, `Proc Energy` correlates more with cache inefficiencies (e.g., `L3MISS`, `L2MISS`), highlighting a higher sensitivity to memory performance.
2. **Instruction Efficiency (IPC)**:
    
    - Linux benefits more from efficient instruction execution, as shown by a stronger negative correlation between `IPC` and energy consumption. Windows exhibits a weaker relationship, indicating less efficient handling of instructions per cycle.
3. **Cache Hits and Misses**:
    
    - Cache hits (`L3HIT`, `L2HIT`) and misses (`L3MISS`, `L2MISS`) show stronger correlations with energy on Windows, suggesting that improving caching mechanisms could reduce energy use significantly.
    - In Linux, cache performance impacts execution cycles (`EXEC`) but not energy consumption as strongly.
4. **Frequency Metrics**:
    
    - Both operating systems show strong positive correlations between energy consumption and frequency metrics, with Windows showing slightly higher dependence. This indicates that frequency scaling policies are critical for both systems.

#### **Actionable Insights**

1. **Linux**:
    
    - Focus on optimizing instruction efficiency (IPC) to reduce energy consumption.
    - Fine-tune dynamic frequency scaling policies to balance performance and power usage.
    - Cache misses have a limited impact; further improvements here may yield diminishing returns.
2. **Windows**:
    
    - Improve cache performance (e.g., reducing `L3MISS` and `L2MISS`) to lower energy costs.
    - Enhance instruction execution efficiency, as `IPC` has a weaker correlation with energy reduction compared to Linux.
    - Explore aggressive frequency scaling policies to mitigate the high energy cost associated with frequency increases.
